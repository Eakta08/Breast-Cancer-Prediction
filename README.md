This project is a machine learning and deep learning based breast cancer prediction system that uses a Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset containing various features related to breast cancer patients.The primary goal is to predict whether a given breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign, which can aid in early diagnosis and medical decision-making. It involved exploring, preprocessing, and modeling data. Multiple algorithms were compared based on key metrics like accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision. The aim was to identify the best-performing model for accurate breast cancer prediction.

**Project Structure:**

- Importing Libraries: *Essential Python libraries are imported for data analysis and machine learning.*
- Data Reading and Exploratory Data Analysis: *The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its characteristics.*
- Data Preprocessing: *Data is preprocessed, including splitting into training and testing sets and scaling.*
- Model Development: *Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied and trained on the dataset.*
- Model Comparison: *The models' performances are compared using evaluation metrics and visualization.*
- Predictive Analysis: *Finally, the models are used to predict breast cancer occurrences.*

**About the Dataset:**
The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is publicly available and commonly used in machine learning for cancer diagnosis tasks. The dataset comprises various numerical features that assist in the classification of breast masses as either benign or malignant.
